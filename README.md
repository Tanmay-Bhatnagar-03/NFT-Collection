## More Details

The dApp has been deployed on Sepolia Testnet of Ethereum. The backend of the dApp has been created using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and is available in the [hardhat-tutorial](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/NFT-Collection/tree/main/hardhat-tutorial) directory. Whitelist smart contract script is available in [hardhat-tutorial/contracts](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/NFT-Collection/tree/main/hardhat-tutorial/contracts) directory and it is written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/). The deployment script for the smart contract is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). <br />
The frontend of the website has been created by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The website automatically sends a prompt to connect your wallet ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) and you are then required to approve the request in the wallet, click the `Join the Whitelist` button and your wallet address is stored in the contract itself (on-chain). Be sure to change your network to [Sepolia](https://sepolia.dev/) in the wallet.
