## More Details

The dApp has been deployed on Sepolia Testnet of Ethereum. The backend of the dApp has been created using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and is available in the [hardhat-tutorial](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/NFT-Collection/tree/main/hardhat-tutorial) directory. Whitelist smart contract script is available in [hardhat-tutorial/contracts](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/NFT-Collection/tree/main/hardhat-tutorial/contracts) directory and it is written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/). The deployment script for the smart contract is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). <br />
The frontend of the website has been created by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The website automatically sends a prompt to connect your wallet ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) and you are then required to approve the request in the wallet.<br />
If you are a whitelisted user, you will be allowed to mint an NFT in the collection by clicking the `Public Mint ðŸš€` button. Be sure to change your network to [Sepolia](https://sepolia.dev/) in the wallet. You can now cross-check that you have received the NFT by going to contract address on [Sepolia Blockchain Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xE68EFffB7caD10C0AdD9522055c4c9F2ee0e2393).<br />
The website is built such that if we want to launch a new collection, the old contract address can be replaced by the newer one and the subsequent steps can be taken such as `Start Presale`, `Presale Mint` and `Public Mint`.
